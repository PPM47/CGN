                        intertwined with the Sri Lankan lifestyle. <br> From our everyday food to delicacies, farm equipment
                         to household items, roofing material and furniture, the coconut tree has been a useful 
                         source of material throughout the centuries.<br> Hence, it has never been a wonder that Sri Lanka is 
                         the fourth-largest exporter of coconut products in the world.<br> The country has been a leading
                         producer of desiccated coconut since the 19th Century and still enjoy a significant share in the 
                         world coconut market mainly through the supply of Desiccated Coconut (DC), considered to be the
                         best in the world due to its lighter colour and sweet and odourless quality.<br> 
                         In addition, the country is the leading supplier of coconut fibre-based products to the global 
                         market and is among the top three producers of activated carbon in the global market.<br> 
                         According to the Coconut Development Authority (CDA), coconut cultivation in Sri Lanka is a 
                         little over one million hectares and Sri Lankans consume nearly 1,750- 2,000 million fresh nuts
                         per year; the remaining harvest is used to produce a range of products from various parts of
                         the coconut.</p>

                                Sri Lankans have a long history of using the coconut kernel to produce a range of food
                                products and ingredients for local consumption as well as export markets.  All Sri Lankan 
                                coconut kernel based products are manufactured using locally harvested coconuts at facilities
                                certified under ISO 22000, FSSC 22000, HACCP, and BRC certifications with no animal abuse throughout

                                Sri Lanka is among the main coir manufacturers in the world with Sri Lankan coir and coir based
                                product manufacturers catering to nearly 40% of the global demand. The country is also the
                                largest supplier of brown fibre to the world with annual exportation of 100,000 mt.
                                Coir fibre products could be categorized based on the raw material used or whether they are recovered 
                                from ripe or immature coconut husks.  The husks of fully ripened coconuts yield brown coir. Brown coir
                                fibre which is strong and highly resistant to abrasion is used primarily in brushes, floor mats, and
                                upholstery padding.  On the other hand, white coir comes from the husks of coconuts harvested shortly 
                                before they ripen. Light brown or white in colour, this fibre is softer and less strong than brown coir.
                                It is usually spun into yarn, which is then woven into mats or twisted into twine or rope.
